## Failover IPv4 Management
It is possible to add Failover IPv4 addresses on your Plesk hosting. This can be useful if you want to associate an IP address per website, or take advantage of a geolocalized IP address.
You can find all information about Failover IP addresses on [this page.](https://www.ovh.com/fr/serveurs_dedies/ip_failover.xml){.external}
Only Failover IP addresses can be routed to Plesk web hosting, not RIPE blocks.

### Questions/Answers

> [!faq]
>
> Do I have root access to my Plesk hosting server ?
>> 
>> As an "as-a-service" offer, you do not have access to the server's root account. This superuser access is only available to OVH administrators.
>> You can also access your Plesk server in SSH by creating a user from your Plesk panel. To do this, in your Plesk panel, use the "Access to web hosting" menu of the domain concerned, then choose a shell type for the domain owner. In order to avoid limitations of access to the server's binaries, we have opened access to non-chrooted shells.
>> If you have actions to assign that require root privileges, please [contact us](#contact_us){.external}, we will study the feasibility of your request.
> What are the limitations of the Reseller account against an Administrator account ?
>> 
>> Your master account of the Plesk panel is a unique reseller account. This is not an administrator account, so some restrictions may apply.
>> The following is a non-exhaustive list of these restrictions :
>> 
>> *Rights available :*
>> - Access to customer management, domains, subscriptions and service packs
>> - Access to tools and user configurations (backup, interface, traffic, resources, etc.)
>> - Access to Service Provider and Power User Views
>> - Access to the Plesk application catalog
>>
>> *Restricted Rights :*
>> - No access to reseller management (access only to your reseller account settings)
>> - No access to tools and global configurations of the server (management of services and daemons, updates, etc.)
>> - No access to the Plesk extensions catalog (do not hesitate to [contact us](#contact_us){.external} if you need an extension, we will study the feasibility of your request)

> [!faq]
>
> How to change PHP values ?
>> 
>> You can modify PHP settings related to your hosting directly from the Plesk panel.
>> You will find information about [this setting in the Plesk guides.](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/12.5/administrator-guide/website-management/websites-and-domains/hosting-settings/web-scripting-settings/php-settings.70742/){.external}
>> 
>> If a value you want to change is not available in the Plesk panel, you can use a *.user.ini* file to place at the root of the directory that should apply this value.
>> Here is [list of PHP directives](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php){.external}, the [configuration modes](http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.modes.php){.external} and how to [use the .user.ini for PHP-FPM.](http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php){.external}
> The mails of my website do not leave
>> 
>> If you have created a new site and activated the mail service for this domain, the emails will then be delivered locally and not returned to the mail server specified in the domain MX fields.
>> If the mailboxes associated with the domain **are not** hosted on your Plesk hosting, disable the mail service of this domain in your Plesk panel.
>> If your mails still do not leave, test with a simple PHP script by sending to an external mailbox (OVH MX / Exchange, Gmail, Hotmail, etc.) to validate the mail server.
> What ports are open on my server ?
>> 
>> As an "as-a-service" offer, the firewall of your Plesk hosting server is managed by the OVH administrators.
>> We are working on adding an option on this offer to let you add or remove your own firewall rules. Do not hesitate to contact our [mailing list](#contact_us){.external} in order to monitor the progress of the roadmap.
>> Do not hesitate to contact us if you wish to open specific ports.
>> 
>> Here are the ports opened by default :
>> *Inbound* : 20, 21, 22, 25, 53, 80, 110, 143, 443, 465, 587, 993, 995, 8443, 8447
>> *Outbound* : 20, 21, 25, 43, 53, 80, 123, 443, 5224, 11371
> Can I access my MySQL / PostgreSQL server from outside ?
>> 
>> Even if the Plesk panel allows you to define MySQL / PostgreSQL user rights from external networks, the MySQL and PostgreSQL ports are closed by the firewall.
>> This is an important security measure to prevent your database server from being accessed from the outside.
>> Please [nous contacter](#contact_us){.external} if you want to open these ports.
> Can I get an IPv6 with my Plesk hosting server ?
>> 
>> There is no IPv6 yet. Since your server is hosted on the OVH infrastructure / cloud, the IPv6 option will be added as soon as it is available on the OVH global / cloud infrastructure.
> Can I benefit from an IP Failover with my Plesk hosting server ?
>> 
>> We are working to add this option to allow you to take advantage of a separate IP per Plesk hosting, and a geolocated IP for your international business.
> Is my Plesk hosting server backed up ?
>> 
>> OVH does not perform a backup of your data. You must make this configuration yourself.
>> Here is how to schedule the backup of your web Plesk hosting : [Configure backup of Plesk and websites](http://docs.plesk.com/en-US/12.5/customer-guide/advanced-backing-up-and-recovering-websites.69566/){.external}
>> This solution will allow you to backup your sites and configurations locally or on an external FTP server.
>> 
>> In addition, we are working on adding an automatic snapshot option to your server.
>


> [!warning]
>
> A snapshot is an image at a time T, the restore is complete and does not restore a file simply, but only the entire server.
> 


> [!faq]
>
> What if I reach the limitations of the license (number of sites, databases, e-mail accounts, etc.) ?
>> 
>> The migration to the superior offer will soon be available.
> Is there a similar offer but based on cPanel ?
>> 
>> We do not have any similar offers based on cPanel yet.
