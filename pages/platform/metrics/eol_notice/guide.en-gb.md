### Chronic crisis

## End of life scope

This end of life involves:

- all Metrics Data Platform services and solutions (free or paid) worldwide.
- OVHcloud API /me/insights and /metrics/* routes.
- The Grafana web interface ( https://grafana.metrics.ovh.net/ ).

This end of life does not concern:

- Logs Data Platform (100% independent solution).

## Migration options and alternative services

OVHcloud does not currently have managed alternatives or migration services.
Solutions are being developed, such as clusters based on M3DB technology.
Since their availability has not yet been confirmed, we recommend deploying an open-source metrics solution like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

These solutions involve a manual migration by the customer. OVHcloud will quickly provide guides, and they will be sent to the concerned customers by email.
